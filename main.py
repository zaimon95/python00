"""
Helper file for Growing Code.

This file helps you test your exercises easily.
Just run: python3 main.py

How it works:
1. It tries to import your exercise files (like ft_plot_area.py)
2. It calls your functions to test them
3. If there's an error, it tells you what went wrong

Make sure your exercise files are in the same folder as this main.py file!
"""


def test_ft_exercise(exercise_file_name):
    """
    This function tries to run one of your exercises.

    For example: test_ft_exercise("ft_plot_area") will:
    - Look for a file called ft_plot_area.py
    - Import it
    - Call the function ft_plot_area() inside it
